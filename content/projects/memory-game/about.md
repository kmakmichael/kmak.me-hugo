A collection of 3 memory-based minigames, made with Unity for a class about designing user interfaces.
We performed playtesting and evaluative studies using classmates as subjects (and participated in their studies too).
From the studies, we were able to compile a list of critiques and suggestions, attached in the Files section.
My team members handled the studies while I made the game.
Whatever assets aren't listed [here](https://github.com/kmakmichael/memory_game/blob/trunk/Assets/credits.txt) I made myself.
Tried to find assets that were licensed for unrestricted use; I wouldn't want to worry about legal stuff for a school project.
