memgame suggestions:
	vault game
		show the note longer for longer sequences x2
		better font
		i wonder if i could use symbols for people unfamiliar with numbers
		a timer when you show the code
		a distraction when you show the code
		hearts or lives
		use the computer num pad or row
		timer for how long the code stays on screen
		see the right answer after you fail
	card game
		flipping animation
		instructional prompt
		show moves during play
		larger board
		show the score more clearly
		maybe lock input when a wrong combo is flipped up
		bigger board when you win instead of just ending the game
	lights game
		timer when showing the correct lights
			or maybe they slowly fade out?
