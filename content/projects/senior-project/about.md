Consisting of 5 members, Team Budget Tesla aimed to fully automate an electric golf cart.
Our 8 months of work culminated in a cart that could detect obstructions and hit the brakes; essentially a $700 brake assist system tacked on with duct tape and Tupperware.
We knew our goals were too lofty, but better to aim high and adjust as we learned.
An easy senior project wouldn't be very much fun.
I worked on the GPS navigation and administration/decisionmaking systems.
