This mostly serves as an online portfolio.
Most of the content here is under [projects/](/projects), where you'll find short descriptions, pictures, and videos for some of the more notable things I've done.
To see the actual code, head to my [GitHub](https://github.com/kmakmichael).
[misc/](/misc) has some acknowledgements and an about page.
We're still under construction here, I just haven't chosen the right web-friendly gif to express this.
Use the tree to explore.

Need to fix my font sizes.
Links are way bigger than text content and the sizes are very off on any viewport that isnt my laptop.
Plus, the fonts themselves need to be subset to decrease the page size by like 1000x.
Good luck if you're on mobile, I haven't gotten around to adapting the page design yet.
Will probably just take the sidebar and move it up top with some CSS, if that's possible.
