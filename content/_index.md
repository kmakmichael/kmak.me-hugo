This mostly serves as an online portfolio.
Most of the content here is under [projects/](/projects), where you'll find short descriptions, pictures, and videos for some of the more notable things I've done.
[misc/](/misc) has some acknowledgements, mad ramblings, and a bit about me.
We're still under construction here, I just haven't chosen the right web-friendly gif to express this.
Use the tree to explore.

Good luck if you're on mobile, I haven't gotten around to adapting the page design yet.
Will probably just take that sidebar and move it up top with some CSS, idk.
