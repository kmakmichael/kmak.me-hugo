## About Me
The standard self-indulgent boasting and hirability metrics are already on my resume and LinkedIn page, so I'd like to make this a bit more casual and personal.
I see a lot of value in experiences.
If you take the time to look around and live in the world around you, there's a lot to discover and enjoy.
Whether it's the simple joy of some nice clouds or a 4-hour relay across Lake Tahoe with a cousin and 5 strangers, I find that the more attention I focus outwards, the more rewarding my time is.


From the pool to the keyboard, I've always been a pretty self-motivated person.
When I like something, I want to do the best I can at it because I enjoy putting work into something and seeing the results.
When I don't like something, I still try to do my best so that I can take pride in my work.
Whatever the situation, I think it's best to focus on the positives and move forwards.
In any case, there will be something to learn and I'm always happy to learn something new.


Philosophy aside, I like a lot of things, water most of all.
I know that's a bit of a weird thing to say, but it tastes good, feels good, smells good: what more could you ask for?
I've been a swimmer all my life, so the stuff's been right there with me for a whole 20-odd years.
Dunking in the pool on a hot summer day, standing up on a surfboard after weeks of trying, surviving a 14,000-yard workout with my teammates, water's kind of a big thing for me.
Plus, I recently discovered lake swimming.
Paddling about on top of 970 feet of fresh water, a mile from the closest shore, surrounded by snow-painted mountains: there might be nothing better than that.
Ocean swimming is lovely too, but the salt and wildlife are always on my mind.
As a final note, think about all the metaphors water gives: going with the flow, fighting the current, a stream of X, an ocean of Y, tears in the rain.
Must be pretty important if we're always comparing things to it, almost like we need it to live or something crazy like that.


Projects are another passion of mine.
Give me some way to record my thoughts and I'll spend hours locked in a room brainstorming.
Better yet, give me somebody to knock ideas with and we might be there for days.
Sewing, hardware design, woodcarving, backpacking, an ugly neon green website: anything can catch my interest and set the gears turning.
What's harder is finding time to do it all, so a good half or more of these projects disappear at the cutting board.
Others still fall to budgetary decisions or shifting interests.
Still fun to plan, but the feeling of finishing a project is like no other; to be able to look at something new and say "I did that".
It's just great to do things, and to see the results of those things I do.
Even if the result is failure or abandonment, if I put some effort in and learn something then I'm pretty satisfied.


I like media, too.
Video games, TV/movies, books, music.
Old or new, there's lifetimes worth of good stuff out there to experience.
Perhaps better than that, I can make more.
I still remember the feeling of watching people have fun with a game I made, it's very satisfying to know that my dumb little school project can have that strong of an effect.
And despite many good memories of reading books under the covers after bedtime or the rare times I got to stay up for the newest episode of Space Dandy on Toonami, it's important to head outside every so often and get some sunlight.
Hiking's awesome, and where I live is perfect for it.
Tons of stuff within 20 miles, and even more a day's trip away.
Even better when the destination is a high viewpoint or a nice body of water.
Snacking on a packed meal or cooking something simple on a gas burner after all that work is too satisfying.
Cooking's a great hobby too.
Not only can you directly enhance the nutrition and enjoyment of your thrice-daily mealtimes, but you can share it with others too.
Much like with the video game, it's awesome to see people enjoy what I make.
Cooking's the kinda thing where you can just put a pot of tried-and-true comfort food in the slow cooker and relax, or get fancy and ad-lib something over a hot pan.
And don't get me started on mochi, I could spend all day pounding that stuff.


## About the Site
I like simple things.
Take it easy, content first, minimal distractions, soft on the eyes and brain.
I've tried to build this website accordingly, though I'm no artist or web wizard.
Static HTML, minimal filesizes, no scripts, etc.
The visuals still need some touching up for comfort and readability, but I'm pretty pleased overall.


Old tube terminals and vector displays provided the aesthetic basis, most importantly [this video](https://youtu.be/YZsiR45tKKw) of the Tektronix 4012.
It's not really an era I lived through, but I enjoy the gentle green glow nonetheless.
Old technology holds this sort of magic that just isn't present in modern polished design.
I do like good sanitary minimalism, but it usually lacks identity or personality.
Page layout was influenced by a few other personal websites I've visited, check the [credits](/misc/credits) page for those.
Exploring the quieter side of the internet is fun and I appreciate sites with that handmade feel to them.


Everything is served by Apache httpd running on OpenBSD and hosted by OVHcloud.
Installation was a bit of a process, but this [guide](https://kaip.iki.fi/2021/01/02/openbsd.html) was useful.
I don't use BSD regularly, but the very small footprint is nice to have, gives more resources to the site.
