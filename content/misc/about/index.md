## The Person

It's hard to talk about myself, I'll have to expand on this later.

The gist of it is that I'm a stupid kid trying to learn how to be less stupid.
The challenges of post-college adulthood are many, but I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
I've done some programming, some artsy stuff, even some sports.
Stagnation is boring, so I'd like to keep learning and doing in whatever future I pursue.

## The Website

I like simple things.
Content first, minimal distractions, easy on the eyes and brain.
I've tried to build this website accordingly.
Static HTML, minimal filesizes, no scripts, etc.
The visuals still need some touching up for comfort and readability, but I'm pretty pleased overall.

Old tube terminals and vector displays provided the aesthetic basis, most importantly [this video](https://youtu.be/YZsiR45tKKw) of the Tektronix 4012.
It's not really an era I lived through, but I enjoy the warm green glow nonetheless.
Old technology holds this sort of magic that just isn't present in modern streamlined design.
Page layout was influenced by a few other personal websites I've visited, check the [credits](/misc/credits) page for those.
Exploring the quieter side of the internet is fun and I appreciate sites with that handmade feel to them.

Everything is served by Apache httpd running on OpenBSD and hosted by OVHcloud.
Installation was a bit of a process, but this [guide](https://kaip.iki.fi/2021/01/02/openbsd.html) was useful.
I don't use BSD regularly, but the very small footprint is nice to have, gives more resources to the site.
