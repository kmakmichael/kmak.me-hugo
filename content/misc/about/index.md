### About Me
The standard self-indulgent boasting and hirability metrics are already on my resume and LinkedIn page, so I'd like to make this a bit more casual and personal.
I see a lot of value in experiences.
If you take the time to look around and live in the world around you, there's a lot to discover and enjoy.
Whether it's the simple joy of some nice clouds or a 4-hour relay across Lake Tahoe with a cousin and 5 strangers, I find that the more attention I focus outwards, the more rewarding my time is.

From the pool to the keyboard, I've always been a pretty self-motivated person.
When I like something, I want to do the best I can at it because I enjoy putting work into something and seeing the results.
When I don't like something, I still try to do my best so that I can take pride in my work.
Whatever the situation, I think it's best to focus on the positives and move forwards.
In any case, there will be something to learn and I'm always happy to learn something new.

### About the Site
I like simple things.
Take it easy, content first, minimal distractions, soft on the eyes and brain.
I've tried to build this website accordingly, though I'm no artist or web wizard.
Static HTML, minimal filesizes, no scripts, etc.
The visuals still need some touching up for comfort and readability, but I'm pretty pleased overall.

Old tube terminals and vector displays provided the aesthetic basis, most importantly [this video](https://youtu.be/YZsiR45tKKw) of the Tektronix 4012.
It's not really an era I lived through, but I enjoy the gentle green glow nonetheless.
Old technology holds this sort of magic that just isn't present in modern polished design.
Page layout was influenced by a few other personal websites I've visited, check the [credits](/misc/credits) page for those.
Exploring the quieter side of the internet is fun and I appreciate sites with that handmade feel to them.

Everything is served by Apache httpd running on OpenBSD and hosted by OVHcloud.
Installation was a bit of a process, but this [guide](https://kaip.iki.fi/2021/01/02/openbsd.html) was useful.
I don't use BSD regularly, but the very small footprint is nice to have, gives more resources to the site.
