### Philosophy

Good web design, I feel, puts focus on the content without compromising style or accessibility.
The internet's primary purpose is to distribute knowledge and information.
Be it academic research, your cousin's honeymoon pictures, or the top 10 celebrities ranked by grip strength (your jaw will drop when you see number 1), information will be distributed.
Above all, a good webpage respects the user's time and intelligence.
To respect the user is to simply present content as it is.

The webpage of 2022, conversely, traps content behind a thick veil of malicious design intended to turn the user into cattle for their engagement and data.
It wastes our time with ads and frivolous content, seeking to drive addictive habits.
With profit as the primary motivation, information is presented as a side dish.
User agency is not respected whatsoever.

I believe that websites should present content in an easy-to-access fashion.
The user should be able to read or watch what they wish, and be presented with similar content to view at their discretion.
To paint the internet as a library, we should be able to sit down and read a book without distractions.
If we enjoy that book, then we can find others like it in the same shelf or section.
The book doesn't shout at us about other pages we should turn to, nor does it flip the pages itself.
Frankly, I'd call such a book haunted and burn it immediately, salting the ashes to drive away whatever spirits dwelled within.

## kmak.me

I've tried to design my website following these philosphies.
I like simple things.
Static HTML, small filesizes, no scripts, basic and minimal but still aesthetically pleasing.
As my first exploration into website creation and design, I'm satisfied with the results.
It still needs some touch-ups though (yes I haven't subset my fonts I'll do that when I've written all the articles).

Old tube terminals and vector displays provided the aesthetic basis, most importantly [this video](https://youtu.be/YZsiR45tKKw) of the Tektronix 4012.
It's not really an era I lived through, but I enjoy the warm green glow nonetheless.
Page layout was influenced by a few other personal websites I've visited, check the [credits](/misc/credits) page for those.

Everything is served by an Apache httpd instance running on OpenBSD and hosted by OVHcloud.
Installation was a bit of a process, but this [guide](https://kaip.iki.fi/2021/01/02/openbsd.html) was useful.
I don't use BSD regularly, but the very small footprint is nice to have
