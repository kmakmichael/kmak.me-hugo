It's hard to talk about myself, I'll have to expand on this later.

The gist of it is that I'm a stupid kid trying to learn how to be less stupid.
The challenges of post-college adulthood are many, but I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
I've done some programming, some artsy stuff, even some sports.
Stagnation is boring, so I'd like to keep learning and doing in whatever future I pursue.
